## pico8-game-template
This is a PICO-8 game template. Use it as a start point for your games.

There is a basic state machine, some util functions and an example of using metatables (kind of Objects in Lua). 

The project also includes a .gitignore file useful for PICO-8 development. 

I hope it is useful for you :)
